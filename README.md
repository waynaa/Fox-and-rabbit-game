# Fox-and-rabbit-game
A fox and rabbit game developed using Java, a machine project implemented as a requirement for CCPROG3.

Mechanics:
1.	The game contains a game board of 20x20 tiles.
2.	The player plays as the fox and can move to the tiles beside it using the arrow keys on the keyboard. Every time the fox moves, the rabbits also move.
3.	At the start of the game, one fox and 3 rabbits will be placed in random tiles on the board.
4.	Every 3 steps of the fox, the number of rabbits doubles.
5.	A rabbit is removed from the board if the fox “eats” the rabbit. That is, if the fox intersects with a rabbit on the same tile.
6.	The game ends when the fox clears the board of all the rabbits (WIN) or when there are 50 rabbits on the board(LOSE)

To run the code:
1. Download ZIP of Fox-and-rabbit-game repository.
